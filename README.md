# django-chatroom

Hello! 
I used most bootstrap for the frontend and some css. This is not as good as I wanted 'cause I don't have a good eye for design :(
I made this project and I plan to improve it in the future adding custom permissions and a profile section.

If you want to run it on your computer 
Just install the requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt in your virtual enviroment
Thank you!
